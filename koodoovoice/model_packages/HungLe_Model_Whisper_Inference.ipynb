We may contact you in the future to offer further products and services. You always have the option to withdraw from receiving this contact from us. Is that alright with you? Erm, sure, no problem now about the tea. Thank you for your understanding Bob. Now regarding your enquiry, sending a £50 box from Shanghai to London would depend on a few factors, such as the shipping method, delivery speed and any additional services you might require.

It's just regular tea, nothing fancy. Got it Bob, thank you for clarifying. Standard shipping for a £50 box from Shanghai to London typically falls within £100 to £200 based on our current rates.
