```
http://localhost:8000/emotion_check/
```

```
http://localhost:8000/whisper_emotion_check/
```

- Disclaimer Verification

```
http://localhost:8000/disclaim_check/

## üîß‚Äç Data Backup & Re-Training & Human Feedback

- We provide the pipeline for monitoring and re-training model, using PerfectCloud for managing & re-training. Take a look on `model_retrain.py` file

- The data backup/ logs is saved in csv file `koo_records_logs.csv` file

- The human feedback is provided by using random model for summary, the user will get it from front end.

----------
## üõ†Ô∏è Security 

- We provide JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure the request. 

## üîÆFuture Plans

We have ambitious plans for the future, with a focus on the following priorities:
